#Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Examples:
Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

###解释
意思就是给你一个整数数组，返回数组内的两个元素相加要等于目标数字的下标，可以架设每个输入只有一个解决方案，相同的元素不能使用2次
###难度
